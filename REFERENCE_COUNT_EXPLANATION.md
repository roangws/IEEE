# Reference Count Discrepancy - Explained

## What You're Seeing

### Warning Messages:
- **"⚠️ 11 external references were selected but not cited in article"**
  - Meaning: You selected 11 external references in Step 2, but didn't actually cite them in your article text
  
- **"⚠️ 42 local references were available but not cited in article"**
  - Meaning: The system found 42 local references in Step 1, but your article only uses some of them

### Total Count:
- **"Showing 65 total references: 36 from local corpus + 29 external sources"**
  - Meaning: Your final article actually cites 65 references (36 local + 29 external)

## Why This Makes Sense

1. **Step 1**: System finds 78 local references in your PDFs
2. **Step 2**: You select 40 external references from search results
3. **Step 3**: You write an article citing only 65 of these references

The warnings are just telling you which references you "had available" but didn't use. This is normal behavior - you don't have to cite every available reference!

## The Numbers Check Out

- Available local: 78 → Used in article: 36 → Not used: 42 ✓
- Selected external: 40 → Used in article: 29 → Not used: 11 ✓
- **Total cited**: 36 + 29 = 65 ✓

## This is Not a Bug

This discrepancy is intentional and helpful:
- It shows you which references you might have forgotten to cite
- It helps you find references you selected but didn't use
- The total count accurately reflects what's in your article

## No Action Needed

The counts are correct. The warnings are just informational to help you manage your references efficiently.
