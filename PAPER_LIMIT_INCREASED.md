# Paper Limit Increased

## Changes Made

- **Maximum papers**: Increased from 100 to 200
- **Default papers**: Increased from 50 to 100
- **Step size**: Remains 5

## Why This Helps

With dynamic filtering:
1. You might fetch 200 papers
2. Filters remove ~50-70% (low relevance, no abstract, generic titles)
3. Still left with 60-100 high-quality papers
4. Better selection for integration

## Recommendation

- Use higher limits (100-150) for broad topics
- Use lower limits (50-80) for specific topics
- The filter log will show retention rate

The slider now goes up to 200 papers!
